## Example input file to compute the intrinsic bispectrum of the cosmic
## microwave background with SONG, and to measure its observability.
##
## The bispectrum will be computed in temperature and polarisation, using the LCDM
## cosmological model with Planck parameters. Its observability will be estimated
## using the Fisher formalism, the resulting Fisher matrix printed to screen.
##
## To make a quick test run to check that SONG runs fine, execute:
##     ./song ini/intrinsic.ini pre/quick_song_run.pre.
## The computation should take less than a minute, but the result will have
## an extremely small angular resolution (l_max=100); however, it is a good 
## test for SONG as all its modules will be executed.
##
## To obtain a physically relevant result, use any of the .pre files in the 'pre'
## directory. For example, for a low precision run try:
##     ./song ini/intrinsic.ini pre/sn_pol_10percent_lmax2000.pre
## The resulting signal-to-noise (sn) will have a moderate angular resolution
## (l_max=2000) and will be accurate to the 10% level for both temperature and
## polarisation. This calculation is likely to take a couple of hours on an 8-core
## machine.
##
## To speed up the computation of the intrinsic bispectrum, exclude polarisation
## (eBisp) from the output field below. You can then expect to obtain a
## 10%-precise result in less than an hour on an 8-core machine by running:
##     ./song ini/intrinsic.ini pre/sn_t_10percent_lmax2000.pre
##
## To fully use the parallelisation, make sure that the openmp flags are enabled
## in the makefile and that the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable is set to
## whatever number of cores you want to use.
##
## This file mixes CLASS and SONG parameters. For a more detailed description of
## each parameter, refer to ini/explanatory.ini in the SONG folder and to
## explanatory.ini in the CLASS folder.

# Values of the l1 and l2 multipoles for which SONG should produce bispectrum output
# files. SONG will create two types of files:
# 
# - A text file for each (l1_out,l2_out) pair with the bispectrum in l1=l1_out and
#   l2=l2_out, tabulated as a function of l3 (bispectra_1D_LXXX.txt). If you give
#   a pair with l2_out < 0, the saved bispectra will have l1=l1_out and l2=l3.
#
# - A larger text for each (l1_out,l2_out) pair with the bispectra in l1=l1_out,
#   tabulated as a function of l2 and l3 (bispectra_2D_LXXX.txt).
#
# The l values will be added to the l-sampling of SONG, so expect the results
# to become more accurate as you increase the number of (l1_out,l2_out) pairs.
# If you give an l_out value larger than l_max_scalars, the latter will be set
# equal to the former.

# Write to file the perturbations and the source function as a function of

#   function tabulated as a function of k3 and conformal time tau
#   (sources_song_kXXX.dat).
#
# Caveats:
# - If two or more triplets are identical, only the first one will generate
#   the perturbations output.
# - Specifying configurations where at the triangular limit, like (0.1,0.1,0.2)
#   will likely result in numerical instability and an error message; use
#   something like (0.1,0.1,0.19999) instead.
# - When using triplets with equal k1 and k2, make sure to order them in
#   ascending k3 order, lest SONG complains.

#   value, with the perturbations in (k1,k2,tau) or (k1,k2,z) as a function of k3
#   (perturbations_song_kXXX_tauXXX.txt and perturbations_song_kXXX_zXXX.txt).
#
# - A binary SOURCES file for every tau_out or z_out value, with the source
#   function in tau or z tabulated as a function of (k1,k2,k3)
#   (sources_song_tauXXX.dat and sources_song_zXXX.dat).
